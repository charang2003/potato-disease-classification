## Overview

This project involves the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify potato plant diseases into three categories: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy. The model aims to assist farmers and agronomists in early detection of these diseases through image classification, potentially improving crop management and yield.

## Problem Statement

Potato crops are prone to various diseases that can significantly affect yield and quality. Early and accurate identification of these diseases is crucial for effective management. Traditional methods of disease detection are often labor-intensive and subjective. This project seeks to automate the detection process using a CNN model trained on labeled images of potato plants, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset

For dataset check Kaggle --> [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of 2,152 images categorized into three classes: `Potato___Early_blight`,`Potato___Late_blight`, and `Potato___Healthy`. The images are pre-processed to a uniform size of 256x256 pixels, with data augmentation applied to enhance model generalization.

- **Image**:

2. **Prediction**: Late Blight

- **Confidence**: 95.4%
- **Image**:

3. **Prediction**: Healthy

- **Confidence**: 95.4%
- **Image**:

### Model Performance Metrics

The model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset. The following metrics were recorded during evaluation:

- **Validation Accuracy**: 96.74%
- **Loss**: 0.0226

The model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between the three classes. However, occasional misclassifications suggest potential areas for further improvement, such as fine-tuning hyperparameters or expanding the training dataset.
